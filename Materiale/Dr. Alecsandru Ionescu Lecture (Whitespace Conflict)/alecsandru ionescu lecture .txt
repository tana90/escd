The biological guided approach for predictable long term esthetic and functional results in implant patients

Technology changes have emerged in communication, education, and healthcare – but especially in dentistry. These changes are leading our way towards ‘digital dentistry’, where most clinics will be relying on digital methods in place of traditional methods.
Many dentists and dental laboratories are adopting these new techniques to improve the quality of work, save time and lower costs.
3D Computer Graphic Analysis of Oral Occlusal Dysfunctions brings the next generation of digitalization to dentistry by implementing the advantages of displaying occlusal interferences in the dynamic movement oft he jaws.   The accuracy of the occlusal design is improved by advanced protection of the occlusal forces which is of importance in planning or monitoring Restorative Dentistry or Prosthodontics (Inlays and Veneers in particular).
The technique can be used in analysis before and after dental treatment as well as a diagnostic tool in CMD/TMD problems.
