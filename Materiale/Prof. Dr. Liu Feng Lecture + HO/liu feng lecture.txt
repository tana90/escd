To establish or to maintain? Strategies for pink esthetics in implantology

Pink esthetics is essential in implant treatment. Both surgical and prosthodontic procedures in implant therapy contribute to the success in pink esthetics greatly. A proper treatment strategy before the operation is an element of great importance for the final success in pink esthetics.

During the surgical procedure of a standard implant placement, we need to establish sufficient peri-implant hard and soft tissue. 
Accurate three-dimensional implant positioning is fundamental to ultimate esthetic effects. Under good bone conditions, freehand immediate implant surgery can achieve good results; if bone conditions are limited, or implant sites are stringent in the anterior area, immediate dental implant placement using digital workflow can achieve more accurate surgical results. 
In the subsequent prosthodontic phase, esthetic parameters and adjacent teeth are taken into consideration to shape the peri-implant soft tissue for optimal pink esthetics. Establishing and transferring the right emergence profile is an important basic technique during the prosthodontic procedure. Conventionally, the emergence profile was shaped step by step into the optimal morphology. Recently, we tend to fabricate provisional restorations according to pre-designed emergence profile, so the peri-implant soft tissue will be shaped in an efficient and direct way. The negative influence on peri-implant structures caused by repeatedly unscrewing abutments could be diminished.

During immediate implant placement procedure, we prefer the concept of maintaining. Throughout the whole treatment, including implant placement, provisional restoration, and final restoration, the natural morphology of the soft tissue is preserved by all means to achieve natural and harmonious pink esthetics.
