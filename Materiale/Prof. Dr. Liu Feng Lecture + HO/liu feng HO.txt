From digital guided immediate implant placement to esthetic chairside restoration

Immediate implant placement is a very important technique, which could simplify the treatment process, shorten the treatment time, and reduce the pain of treatment. Most patients are willing to accept immediate implantation if necessary and possible

For patients who need to receive implant on the site with a hopeless tooth, no matter if the site is in the anterior, premolar or molar area, we will assess the feasibility and risk of immediate implant placement first. Whenever possible, immediate implant placement would be the first choice.

With good bone conditions, immediate implant placement by free hand may achieve good results; with compromised bone conditions, or on very challenging implant sites in the anterior area, immediately implant placement under digital guidance can achieve more accurate surgical results. The first part of this lecture focuses on the methods and skills of DMG digital guide plate.

In order to achieve better final aesthetic effect, we recommend immediate restoration for immediate placed implant. The second part of this lecture focuses on the methods of making immediate implant prostheses.
