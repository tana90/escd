Partial extraction therapy and immediate/delayed implant placement 

Prof. Andre P. Saadoun 
 
Each tooth extraction is always followed by a collapse of the gingival margin, an alveolar bone resorption in particular on the buccal cortical plate and a deformed ridge after a minimal of 2-12 weeks Maintaining the buccal Contour of the Root Emergence at the time of the tooth extraction and after, is may be another way to prevent soft tissue recession and crestal bone level change to occur The most scientific based modalities of Traitement following this clinical biological concept ate the following 
ROOT SUBMERGENCE TECHNIQUE 
The purpose is to keep the all root and to grind 2 mm below the healthy gingival margin, keeping the connective fibers at the root and above the bone level.  The advantages of Root Submergence Procedure for Pontic Site Development in Esthetic Implant therapy should be considered as an Alternative to standard Socket Preservation Technique to maintain the PDL Fibers Apparatus inter-proximal Height of Bone and Ridge Dimensions
 
SOCKET SEAL SURGERY 
 This clinical procedure combines the Preservation and the Augmentation of the extraction site with or without Immediate implant placement ,by using an allogenic bone graft in the alveolar Socket ,covered by an oversized Epithelio Connective Tissue graft delicately sutures in strategic location to insure a perfect stability and vascularization Few months after the initial contour and volume are maintained and the implant could be exposed with a roll Technique or the Implant could be place in the correct 3D position  
ROOT SHIELD TECHNIQUE  
Maintaining the buccal part of the root at the time of the tooth extraction is may be another way to prevent crestal bone level change and soft tissue recession Volumetric Analysis shows a low degree of Contour Changes from Extraction Implant Placement after 5 years follow up. Mucosal Recession at implant restoration site contour was comparable to that of the adjacent teeth. This Study offers reduced invasiveness at the time of surgery and high esthetic outcomes with effective preservation of the facial tissue contours However this technique should not be used routinely, until higher evidence in the form of Clinical, trials is available »
