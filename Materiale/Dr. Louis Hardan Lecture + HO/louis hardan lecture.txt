Dental documentation and communication: a new easy way for everyone, every day.

Abstract: Photography is powerful in dentistry, its numerous applications such as diagnosis and treatment planning, legal documentation, publishing and lecturing has made digital photography a standard of care in modern dental practices.
Till last year the DSLR (Digital Single Lens Reflex) cameras were the only way in dentistry to take high quality macro images. 
Recently, smartphones have come a long way in digital photography due to recent technology development. 
The purpose of this lecture is to demonstrate the capacity of these devices to take high quality dental images for our daily documentation and to present a new device for mobile photography: the Smile Lite MDP, which is very simple to use and allows to take high quality dental pictures with mobile phones. 
Those pictures are useful in different types of documentation and communication, in a feasible teachable and repeatable way, by everyone and for everyday practice.
