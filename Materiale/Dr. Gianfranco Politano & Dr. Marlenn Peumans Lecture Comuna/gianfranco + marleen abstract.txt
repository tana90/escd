Indirect bonded partial restorations in the posterior region â€“ new concepts 

Restoration of large defects in the posterior region with a direct composite restoration is possible, although this is not an easy task for the dentist. The most durable, minimal invasive restoration of posterior teeth with large defects is the indirect bonded partial lithium disilicate glass ceramic restoration (onlay, partial crown). During this lecture, the new concepts of indirect partial bonded restorations in the posterior region will be discussed going from indications - preparation - immediate dentin sealing/dentin margin elevation and cementation.
