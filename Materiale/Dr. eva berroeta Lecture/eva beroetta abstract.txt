Title: â€œErosive patients how to treat them from the beginning to the end"
Dental erosion is a multidisciplinary etiologic factor that affects 30% of young population, destroying great amount of tooth structure.
Traditional prosthetic techniques are based on healthy tooth estructure removal that are restored by using crowns and fixed partial prosthesis.
Nowadays thanks to predictable enamel and dentin bonding, new materials that can be bonded to such tooth estructures and thanks to digital dentistry, we are able to treat erosive patients in a more conservative, additive and
more predictable way.
Thru this lecture It will be discussed how to treat erosive patients from the diagnosis, treatment planning, sequence and material selection.
