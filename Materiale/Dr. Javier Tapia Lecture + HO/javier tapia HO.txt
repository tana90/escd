Essentia: the smart simplification of direct composite restorations.

Leonardo da Vinci said that simplicity is the ultimate way of sophistication. When it comes to developing an aesthetic dental composite material, we tend to overcomplicate things, caused either by old recurring concepts, by industry competitiveness or by wrong analysis of nature observation. However, ultimate simplification is possible when we jump across these problems and start from scratch. Developed within the GC Europe Restorative Advisory Board, Essentia represents the minimalism inside the composite world, a simplified system that enables an easy but effective aesthetic restoration with a very limited amount of shades. The complete kit, with just 7 shades and 4 modifiers, becomes a paradigm shift in layering composites.
