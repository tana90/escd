Managing the perio-restorative interface of different abutment types in the  smile zone – Concepts and strategies.
 

In order to achieve a harmonious esthetic result of an indirect restoration at the smile zone - the operators should not only choose the material of the restoration, but also analyze and relate to the abutment type and color, and to the integration of the whole restorative complex with the surrounding tissue, whether of a natural tooth (vital or non-vital), or an implant. 
In cases where different types of abutments should be restored at the same arch, the treatment is even more challenging. One should plan ahead the different phases of the perio-restorative treatment in order to end up with a harmonious natural looking result, by choosing the most suitable materials for each site, so that the combined abutment-crown complexes will blend with each other, as well as with the adjacent dentition and with the vital periodontium, in esthetic and healthy conditions.   

State of the art strategies will be presented where different abutment types of teeth and implants are to be restored, utilizing diverse laboratory and clinical restorative techniques, utilizing different tissue management techniques. 

The concepts of Model Based Restoration and Cervical Contouring will be presented and analyzed in a variety of esthetically challenged clinical cases.
