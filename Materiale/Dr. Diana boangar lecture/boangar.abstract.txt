Ortho-prosthetics interdisciplinarity; from planning to execution

            Published in 2010, a study conducted between MIT and Union College demonstarted that collective intelligence exceeds cognitive abilities of individual group members. The principle also applies to medicine. The process of decision making is nowadays influenced by the continous flux of information, the evolution of the technology, and the development of new protocols and evidence-based procedures. But the most powerful tool that we have available is communication with other specialists.
          Those cases that fall into the “gray zone” and for which no individual approach offers optimal esthetic and functional results, compel us to integrate other specialists in our treatment planning. Among them, ortho- prosthetics collaboration plays a special role, due both to the complex facetes it carries and to the time factor. A well conducted, individualized orthodontic treatment may turn a difficult- in a medium difficulty-grade case, and one that requires great sacrifice of dental or periodontal tissues into a minimally invasive approach.
	That is why it’s important for us to recognize the complex problems our patients may have, our own limits in adressing those issues, to individualize protocols and find the common ground to efficiently communicate with the orthodontist.
	The objectives of the presentation are:
 Recognize clinical situations when interdisciplinary collaboration is indicated
 Recognize clinical situations in which orthodontic correction may make the difference between an ordinary and an excellent outcome
 Present a clinical time-proven protocol of interdisciplinary collaboration
 Illustrate it through clinical examples.
