My digital reality-How technology changes the way we practice

We are living in a world where technology is everywhere. In this lecture, I will show you how we, as dentists, can use the technology to make our dentist life better. I will focus on the digitalization of the prosthetics and show you what possibilities we have to change from the analog to digital. Is it possible to change a smile in one day? Is it possible to deliver high precision, high quality and high esthetics using digital impressions and the cad-cam technology? If you choose the right system for what u need, it is possible. I will also present some cases, done only with digital technology: from planning to final restoration, from single partial crown to full esthetic smiles.
