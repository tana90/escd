In this Hands on course, I will show you how you can integrate the 3D solutions in your Practice. We will start with an Intra oral scan and we will go through prosthetics, orthodontics, implant planning with or without immediate loading. All the doors are open if you choose the system that you need. In a few years, intra oral scanning will be state of the art in taking (digital) impressions. Do you know everything that you can do with it? Join us to find out what you can do with the technology that we have today.
