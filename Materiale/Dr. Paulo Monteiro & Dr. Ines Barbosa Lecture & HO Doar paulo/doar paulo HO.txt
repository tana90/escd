Some of these techniques use several different opacities and increments of composites, leading to the dentist get confused in deciding which one to choose. The clinical reality of most dental clinics are based on simple procedures, easy to perform with suitable aesthetic and longlasting results. Some simple layering techniques makes the dentist daily work simple and predictable, enabling make direct esthetic and invisible composite resin restorations.
In this Hands-On course we intend to work with a simplified technique for esthetic restorations, use only two opacities of composite resines. We will discuss the step by step clinical procedures in anterior tooth in order to preserve the remaining tooth tissue and follow the harmony and properties of the natural teeth. The participants will have the opportunity to make a class IV restoration in a central incisor applying the technique lectured, from the planning to finishing and polishing.
