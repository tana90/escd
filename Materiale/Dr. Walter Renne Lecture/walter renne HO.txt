How to create a pre-surgical provisional restoration from an implant plan. 

2D and 3D smile design for implant planning and manufacturing of pre-surgical provisional restorations.  Participants will use smile design and 3D intraoral scanning to virtually plan an implant in the esthetic zone. They will then use this plan for designing of a 3D printed surgical guide and also a pre-surgical provisional.
