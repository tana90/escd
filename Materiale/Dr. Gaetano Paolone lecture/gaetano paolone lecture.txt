Translucency as the key factor in esthetic outcome in direct anterior and posterior restorations.

Abstract:
When planning a restoration, the color of the substrate should also be taken into account in order to achieve a satisfactory esthetic outcome. In some clinical situations, clinicians are asked to hide the substrate with the restoration; in other situations, clinicians can take advantage of an unaltered color substrate and therefore select less opaque materials that exploit the color of the underlying tissue. Differences in direct anteriors and direct posteriors will be outlined during the lecture.
