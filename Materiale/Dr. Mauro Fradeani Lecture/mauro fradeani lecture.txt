The prosthetic revolution
Designing full-mouth complex rehabilitations on natural dentition and implants with optimum esthetics requires correct treatment planning, evaluation of the most suitable ceramic material and advanced skills. Today technology validly supports the clinician in the definition of an ideal treatment plan thanks to GETApp, an App that collects and processes digitally all the necessary data. The use of metal-free ceramic materials allows the restorative dentist to obtain excellent esthetic results while dramatically reducing the need to remove sound tooth structure. This MIPP technique (Minimally Invasive Prosthetic Procedure) represents an undeniable advantage when facing highly compromised clinical situations.
